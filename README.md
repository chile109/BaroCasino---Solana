## Concept:

![Project Structure](https://github.com/chile109/Barocasino/blob/main/assets/project_structure.png)

BaroCasino offers a unique decentralized platform for hosting and participating in gaming tournaments. The platform's architecture is designed to accommodate two main roles: **Tournament Creators** and **Tournament Players**, facilitating a seamless flow from the creation of a tournament to the distribution of rewards.

## Roles
### Tournament Creators:
Tournament Creators are the backbone of the BaroCasino ecosystem. They initiate tournaments by creating candy machine NFTs, which serve as membership tickets for players to buy and participate in the tournaments. The process for Tournament Creators involves:
- **Creating NFTs**: These NFTs act as access tokens for the tournaments. Creators decide the terms, rewards, and structure of the tournaments.
- **Hosting Tournaments**: Once the NFTs are minted, creators can set up tournaments on the BaroCasino platform, inviting players to join and compete.

### Tournament Players:
Players engage with the platform by participating in these tournaments. Their journey within the BaroCasino ecosystem involves several steps:
- **Purchasing NFTs**: Players buy NFTs from the marketplace, granting them membership and the ability to join tournaments.
- **Participating in Tournaments**: Using their NFTs, players enter tournaments, compete, and aim for the top positions to win rewards.
- **Claiming Rewards and NFTs**: At the end of a tournament, players can claim their rewards along with their staked NFTs, which can be reused for future tournaments or traded.
